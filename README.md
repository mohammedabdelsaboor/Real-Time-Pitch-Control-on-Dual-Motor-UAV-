# Real-Time-Pitch-Control-on-Dual-Motor-UAV-
This project demonstrates a simplified drone-like bi-copter stabilization system using two brushless motors, a GY-87 IMU (MPU6050), and a PID controller on Arduino. It applies control theory to maintain pitch balance in real time, with serial commands for dynamic setpoint adjustment and safety.
